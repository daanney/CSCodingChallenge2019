# Java skeleton

This skeleton incorporates changes for the Java skeleton for the TA Coding Challenge. 

The contents of the folder will need to copied and pasted into your skeleton repositories at the root directory in order for submissions to be valid.

To run tests locally, simply run all tests using your favoured IDE. Please note that this won't produce a green or red build - test results will be printed out to your console.

## PLEASE NOTE: Once you have copied and pasted the files, DO NOT edit any files in src/test/ or the .travis.yml file.

Good luck!
